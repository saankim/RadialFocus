## Overview
RadialFocus introduces a geometry-aware Graph Transformer that uses a lightweight, distance-modulated attention mechanism with learnable radial basis functions. It achieves state-of-the-art results on molecular property prediction and general graph benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters.
